In this section, we will look at terms and factors in expressions. Let's start by introducing some key vocabulary.      Terms are separated by plusses and minuses.    Before you continue, you might notice all the examples. After most \"learning bits\", like definitions, strategies, etc., we have an example, which we encourage you to try. After all, you will only learn math by doing problems, not reading about us doing problems.    How many terms are in the expressions below?                        There are 3 terms: , , and .

You should make sure to try them BEFORE you look at the answers (I know you all too well :) ). If you are stuck, you should look at the hint, but PLEASE don't look at the answer. This ruins the whole point of the exercise. It is for you to do it, not us.   In each part, there is an expression. For each term, state the factor(s).       Where should the addition signs go?

Read carefully; this content will be important later on.   First, we must understand like terms . Like terms are terms that have the same variables and the same exponents.    Like terms are terms that have the same variables and the same exponents.      Identify all the like terms in the expression: .    Let's identify all of the factors in each term.   Term  Factors                ab  a, b     2, , c   Next, let's identify the terms that have the same variables (like a), and exponents. has the variables and . Could be a like term? No. The exponents for b are 2 and 1. The exponents for 2ab are 1 and 1. The exponents aren't the same. You cannot add and a. It turns out there aren't any like terms for a b. Let's move on. Are there any like terms for ? Notice the variables are a and c. What other terms have a and c as factors? works. Are the exponents the same? Notice there is an (a with an exponent of 2) in both terms. Both terms also have c (with no exponent), too. So, the variables and exponents are the same. and are like terms.  Your turn. Does 2ab have any like terms? What are its variables? What are its exponents? Are there any other terms that have the same variables and the same exponents?     Identify the like terms in the expression .    and 3yx , 9x and x , 3yx has no like terms  We can add like terms like so:   Simplify the expression .    We can write 2ab as \"ab + ab\" and 3ab as \"ab + ab + ab\". Thus, 2ab + 3ab = ab + ab + ab + ab + ab. Just as 4 + 4 + 4 = 3 4, ab + ab + ab + ab + ab = 5 or 5ab. Notice that we also could just add the coefficients (like 2 and 3 in 2ab and 3ab) to get 5ab.      A coefficient of a term is a constant factor. For example, the coefficient of 2a would be 2.     When combining like terms, we can just add the coefficients.   Let's do an example regarding coefficients.    For each term below, find the coefficient.   ac    4mx    9x    17p     4y          The coefficient is 1. If no coefficient is given, assume the coefficient is 1.  The coefficient is NOT a. a is a variable, not a constant.      The coefficient is 4.    The coefficient is 9.    The coefficient is 17.    The coefficient is -4. Were you about to say 4 (positive 4)? Remember your signs!        Remember your signs! -4 is not the same as (positive) 4!     Simplify the expression .    This problem is slightly more complex. First, we must identify like terms. We can see that xy and 2xy are like terms. There are no other sets of like terms in this expression. Next, we need to add our like terms. We can write xy as 1xy . Then, we can add the coefficients. . Let's put that back into the expression. is our final answer.      Simplify the expression 4x - x.    Let's write this out. x means 1x, so -1x would just be -x. 4x would be x + x + x + x. Writing this out, we get, x + x + x + x - x. x - x is 0, so we get x + x + x or 3x. Notice we could also have noticed that the coefficient of -x is -1, and you might have just added 4 and -1 to get the coefficient 3.      Simplify the expression .    What's wrong with this solution?  Bogus Solution  Since the variables and exponents are the same, we can combine 3xy and 4xy to get 7xy.  Were you about to make that error? It turns out that 3xy and 4xy are not like terms. In fact, they are not terms at all. There is only one term in the expression given. Do you see why?     Multiplication is not addition. You cannot add coefficients of factors. Multiplying two factors is NOT combining like terms.    Simplify the following expressions.       6am   Add the coefficients. 9 + (-3) is 6. Thus, the coefficient must be 6; we get 6am.   4ac + 4ab    4ac + 4ab    Notice that there are no like terms in 4ac + 4ab because the variables are not the same. Thus, this expression cannot be simplified.   8abc - 7ac + 3abc   5abc - 7ac    Identify the coefficient in each term in the expression below.      The coefficient of 6m is 6. The coefficient of is -5. The coefficient of 3p is 3.   "

  "body": " Multiplying Exponents   Hopefully, you feel relatively comfortable with the ideas presented last lesson. We will continue on this idea by disassembling exponents and exploring properties of these exponents.     Expand the exponent     We know that 2 is 2 multiplied by itself 3 times, so we write it as .      Expand the exponent .    Let's use the logic from the previous example to write this as .      Simplify the expression .    Well, let's start by expanding , which we write as . We will now expand , which we write as . Let's write this out fully: . Now, we can write that as an exponent, similar to what we did in Lesson 1. We are multiplying x by itself 5 times, so we get as our final answer.    In the last example, notice how we combined the exponents.    When multiplying exponents, you can add the exponents. Or, in math terms, .    Now let's do some more examples.    Simplify the expression .    Let's do this 2 ways. First, we can do it the long way that writes it out, and then let's do it the short way. First up, let's do the long way! We can write as and as . Multiplying those together, we get or . Let's do it the 2nd way. We will add the exponents first: 4 2 is 8, so x  x is x .      Simplify the expression .    Let's do this the fast way: , so .      Simplify the expression .    What's wrong with this solution?  Bogus Solution  Let's add the exponents. 2 + 3 = 5, so .  Do you remember the rules for adding terms? You can only add terms if their variables and their exponents are the same. Is x the same as ? No. The exponents are different. So, there are no like terms, and you cannot simplify. Did you make this mistake? (The solution should be .)     You cannot add terms with different exponents.     Simplify the expression .    What's wrong with this solution?  Bogus Solution  There isn't any exponent for y, so the exponent for y stays as 3. Thus, the solution is .  Remember, if no exponent is written, you should write the exponent as 1. Thus, the expression would be , and we can simplify that to be .     If no exponent is specified, write the exponent as 1.     Simplify the expression .    What's wrong with this solution?  Bogus Solution  We can add the exponents, getting .  We can only combine exponents if the base is the same. is NOT . Thus, the answer should be .     We can only combine exponents whose bases are the same.    Simplify the expression .       Write as . Thus, we add the exponents as follows: . Thus, the answer is .    Simplify the expression .       Write as . We add the exponents: 3 + 2 + 1 = 6. Thus, the final answer should be .    Simplify the expression    Add the exponents: 2 + 9 = 11, so .    Simplify the expression .   What would you do here? Do the normal rules apply?       Add the exponents as normal: -1 + 3 = 2, so .   The next exercise will be more challenging.   Simplify the expression .   First, we need to do multiplication. We can write as , which we can rearrange as . First do , which is 6. Add the exponents: . So, we have . Now we must add like terms: and are like terms, so adding those gets . Thus, our answer is .    Simplify the expression .   This isn't any different to previous problems. We just add the exponents to get .   Did these exercises make sense to you? Next section, we will look at dividing exponents. Are you ready?  "
